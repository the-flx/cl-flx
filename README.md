# cl-flx
> Rewrite emacs-flx in Common Lisp

[![CI](https://github.com/the-flx/cl-flx/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/the-flx/cl-flx/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This doesn't count as a rewrite since the original [Emacs][]' [flx][]
written in Emacs Lisp are very close to Common Lisp.
I only need to make tiny changes, which I consider effortless.

## üî® Usage

```lisp
(flx:score "buffer-file-name" "bfn")  ; '(237 0 7 12)
```

## üõ† Development

To run tests, you need [Qob][] and execute the following commands:

```sh
$ qob install-deps --dev
$ qob test
```
